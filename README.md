# JG-Keystone Generator

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator based on the [Keystone Generator](https://github.com/keystonejs/generator-keystone) created by [JedWatson](https://github.com/JedWatson).

It is intended for use with the v0.3.x branch of [My Modified Fork](https://github.com/JGRoeder/generator-jg-keystone) of [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs).

## Usage

Chances are you want to use the original [Keystone Generator](https://github.com/keystonejs/generator-keystone) created by [JedWatson](https://github.com/JedWatson).

Which utilizes [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs) an excellent Node.js CMS & Web Application Platform.

Thus I have not incuded detailed usage instructions here. Generally speaking, it should be very similar to the usage described in the original KeystoneJS readme.

## Differences

This generator simply uses a [Modified Version](https://github.com/JGRoeder/generator-jg-keystone) of KeystoneJS

The main purpose of which at the moment, is support for markedOptions, as an option of the Markdown field type.
